## Set Up
When setting up the project, if you use MacOS, your application needs to start with the "-XstartOnFirstThread" JVM argument. 
This means, before launching the project for the first time, enter the Run/Debug Configurations and add the "-XstartOnFirstThread" to the "Add VM Options" textbox. 

## Playing the Game
Launch the program and press the “Start” button to play the game. 
You will be redirected to the “IntroScreen”, where you can navigate around using the arrow keys (zoom is possible by pressing m or n). 
Use the number keys (1 through 4) to enter the different adventures. To navigate through the stories, use the Enter key. 
You can quit the stories at any point in time via the Escape key.
